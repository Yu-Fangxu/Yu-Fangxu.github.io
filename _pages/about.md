I am a second-year master's student from the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) of [Nanjing University](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) and serve as a member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/index.html), advised by [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) and [Zhen Wu](https://wuzhen247.github.io/). Previously, I obtained a B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). You can find my CV here: [Yu Fangxu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf)

My research interests lie in machine learning and natural language processing, including
<ul>
<li>Sentiment analysis and dialogue modeling<br /></li>
<li>Controllable and constrained text generation<br /></li>
<li>Graph learning applications in NLP<br /></li>
</ul>
