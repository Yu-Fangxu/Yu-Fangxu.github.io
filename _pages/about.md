I am a second-year master's student from the [School of Artificial Intelligence of Nanjing University](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) and serves as a member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/index.html), advised by [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) and [Zhen Wu](https://wuzhen247.github.io/). Previously, I obtained her B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in machine learning and natural language processing, including
1. Sentiment analysis and dialogue modeling
2. Controllable and constrained text generation
3. explainability and trustworthiness of graph models
4. Graph learning applications in NLP
