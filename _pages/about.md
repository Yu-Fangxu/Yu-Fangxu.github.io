I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yaodong Yu](https://yaodongyu.github.io/) and [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). Previously, I earned my master's degree in Computer Science at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) and bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). You can find my CV here: [Yu Fangxu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).

My recent research topics include:

(1) LLM/MLLM Reasoning: [Flow of Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673), [TS-Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03519), [ArrowGEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06559v1), TSRBench

(2) Probabilistic Inference for NLP: [Flow of Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673), [COLD-Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08679)

(3) Agent: [ArcMemo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04439)

(4) Emotional/Psychological Dialogue: [EACL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20289), [ECGN](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.88/), [PersuasiveToM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21017)


## News
May 2025: One paper is accepted to Findings of ACL 2025! We propose an emotional contagion graph network (ECGN) inspired by the emotional contagion process in social interaction, which aims to improve emotion cause recognition by leveraging non-verbal information.

May 2025: One paper is accepted to ICML 2025! We adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to LLM multi-step reasoning, which aims to improve the capability of LLMs to find multiple solutions for each problem. 

May 2024: One paper is accepted to ICML 2024! We adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD) to develop the COLD-Attack framework, which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right coherence.

March 2024: One paper is accepted to Findings of NAACL 2024! We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to better distinguish similar emotions in Emotion Recognition in Conversation.

Sep 2021: I'm admitted to study for an M.Sc. degree in the School of Artificial Intelligence at Nanjing University without an entrance examination.

July 2021: Awarded as Excellent Camper by the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
